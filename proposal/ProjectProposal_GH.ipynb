    "I hypothesize that the higher rating of a park on google maps would correspond to a better air quality of this park because I think the higher rating could generally reflect environment of the park. Air quality is one of the most important factors when assessing the environment of a particular park so I assume that the park with high ratings on google maps tend to have a better environment. In another word, better air quality."
